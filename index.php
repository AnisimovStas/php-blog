        <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content that’s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.</p>

        <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
        <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
        <p>This is an example blockquote in action:</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>Quoted text goes here.</p>
        </blockquote>

          <h3>Example table</h3>
          <p>And don't forget about tables in these posts:</p>
          <table class="table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Upvotes</th>
                <th>Downvotes</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Alice</td>
                <td>10</td>
                <td>11</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Bob</td>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>3</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Charlie</td>
                <td>7</td>
                <td>9</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
            <tfoot>
              <tr>
                <td>Totals</td>
                <td>21</td>
                <td>23</td>
              </tr>
            </tfoot>
          </table>

          <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout.</p>
